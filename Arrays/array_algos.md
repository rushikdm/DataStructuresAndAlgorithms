# Arrays

## Definition
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using an index.

## C++ array facilities
### Arrays on stack
1. Normal arrays
2. std::array<> template

### Arrays on heap
1. Explicitly memory allocated arrays using new operator
2. vector<> template class

## Array algorithms

### Linear search: Bruteforce approach
### Binary search: Decrease and conquer
### Two pointer technique
### Sliding window technique
### Sort algorithms
### Transform and conquer

## Array problems

### Linear search: Bruteforce approach
1. Find the index of some number in unsorted array if present otherwise return -1
2. Find minimum value in unsorted array
3. Find maximum value in unsorted array
4. Find both minimum and maximum values in unsorted array

Find the frequency of values in unsorted/sorted array.
### Binary search: Decrease and conquer
1. Find the index of some number in sorted array if present otherwise return -1
2. Find the start and end indices in sorted array containing given value (lower and upper bound, equal_range function in C++)
3. Find element in sorted array with value equal to index
4. Find the index of min number in sorted rotated array
5. Find the index of max number in sorted rotated array
6. Find missing number in sorted ascending array.
7. Find the number with duplicate entries in sorted ascending array.
8. Find minimum in 2D array with sorted rows and columns.

### Two pointer technique
1. Reverse an array
2. Find two distinct elements in sorted array whose sum is equal to the specifed value.
3. Find two distinct elements in sorted array whose product is equal to the specifed value.
4. Findd max length of sub-array with non decreasing values.
5. Partition an array around given element such that all elements less than should come to left and all elements should come to right side
6. Find median in array.
7. Find kth largest element in array.
8. Find mode in unsorted array.

### Sliding window technique
1. Find all subarrays that add upto a given sum.
2. Max sum subarray problem.

### Sort algorithms
1. Insert an element in sorted array
2. Merge two sorted arrays into one bigger sorted array.
3. Implement bubble sort algorithm.
4. Implement Insertion sort algorithm.
5. Implement selection sort algorithm.
7. Modify selection sort algorithm by proceeding from both ends by finding both min and max.
8. Implement merge sort algorithm.

### Transform and conquer
1. Suffix sum array to address range sum queries.
2. Range update data structure. Perform efficient updates to add a number to all the entries in specified ranges.
